Versions of a website I'm building completely from scratch.

The end goal is to have clickable buttons I can use to switch between different versions of the website in order to see my progress over time.

Right now the document is...ugly. 

The point is to provide an opportunity for myself to come through and practice using GitHub for all the work-related activities I'll be doing in the near futute.

As a nice benefit, this will serve as a sandbox for me to play around with my skills as they gradually improve.

Developer progression chart included on website will be my roadmap over the summer and beyond.

I'm up for a challenge, apparently. Feeling pretty cool that I'm building and editing live code.
